# buscall
A trial at using LTA DataMall's Dynamic Dataset. 
Based on the user's input bus stop, the app will return a list of incoming bus services at that stop, their timing, type of bus, and availability. 
An API key can be obtained from https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/request-for-api.html
